Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Seedlings of the four dominant alpine/subalpine shrub species were randomly harvested from a heathland site that was burnt by a January 2003 wildfire. At least 30 individuals were sampled in each species. Seedlings collected for harvest spanned the range of sizes present at the site, and always occurred in bare ground patches (hence were exposed to direct sunlight)."
Height,Height was measured as the vertical distance from the ground to the highest apex. This measurement was made using calipers
Diameter at crown base,Diameter of stem at first branch. This diameter was measured using a caliper prior to harvesting
Diameter at stem base,Diameter of stem at ground level. This diameter was measured using a caliper prior to harvesting
Leaf mass,All leaves on each seedling were dried in a oven for 48 hours at 70oC
Stem mass,Stems and branches of each seedling were dried in a oven for 48 hours at 70oC
Total mass,Total mass was the sum of leaf and stem dry mass.
Year collected,2010
