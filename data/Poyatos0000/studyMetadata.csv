Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Mountain birch trees in the studied taiga-tundra ecotone are polycormic (i.e. multi-stemmed). We were interested in deriving allometric equations at the stem level. We harvested 15 stems, belonging to 5 individuals (genets).  For each stem, stump diameter (diameter at 0.1 m height), diameter at breast height and stem height were recorded. Other measurements were taken in trees nearby (sapwood area, leaf nitrogen)."
Leaf area,"LMA was calculated for a representative sample of branches (N=3-26, depending on tree size), using standard methods (N~10 leaves per sampled branch, area measured with Delta-T image analysis system 1.10).  Leaf area per branch was was estimated using leaf dry mass and specific LMA; all branches were added to compute whole stem leaf and wood mass."
Stem cross sectional area,Stem diameters were measured with diameter tape in two perpendicular directions. Sapwood area at breast height was estimated visually according to changes in wood translucency of freshly-cut stem disks.
Height,Stem height was measured with measuring tape.
Biomass,"The stem fraction and leaves from each stem were separated, dried (48h, 60 degC) and weighed."
Traits,Leaf nitrogen measured using a Carlo Erba NA 2500 Elemental Analyser.

Remarks,"The study site was close to the Kevo Subarctic Research Station. Data are unpublished; derived allometric equations only used to estimated LAI as reported in: Poyatos et al., 2012, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, Volumes 158-159, 15 Pages 90-100. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2012.02.009."
