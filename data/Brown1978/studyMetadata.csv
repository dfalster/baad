"Topic","Description"
"Sampling strategy"," The sampling was designed to include the natural variation in crown weight by selecting trees from stands on poor-to-good sites and from low-to-high stand density conditions throughout western Montana and nothern Idaho."
"Leaf area"," Not measured."
"Stem cross sectional area","DBH outside bark."
"Height","Total tree height (includes stump)."
"Crown area","Crown width was measured as the average of two perpendicular measurements taken at the bottom of each crown section."
"Biomass","Fresh weight was measured by crown section in the field, and converted to dry mass using moisture content determined from sample branches. For small trees, most or all of the entire crown was often ovendried."
"Growth environment","Naturally grown."
