Sampling strategy,"Harvest was conducted in a 3 0.01-ha subplots (10 m ~ 10 m) in a broadleaf forest plot (20 m  ~ 95 m) at Sanbe Forest of Shimane University in August 1983 (Katagiri et al. 1984). All trees with diameter >= 4.8 cm were felled. Additionally, three trees with diameter >= 25 cm were felled from other plots. Trees felled in 1976 and 1982 were also reported. After felling, stem diameters at breast height, tree height, and height of the lowest living branch were measured. Fresh weights of stem, branches, and leaves were measured."
